EQUINE (or Easy & Quick Install Environment) is a mod manager for the first Diablo game. EQUINE can download, update and uninstall mods created for the game. 

You can select a ddraw.dll wrapper that works best for your system for each individual mod.


EQUINE uses JSON as the mod database and it updates the file on every launch, keeping you fresh at any new mod that was submitted to EQUINE.

Currently EQUINE has the following features:
- Copy DIABDAT.MPQ from game CD
- Choose either StrangeBytes' or DDrawCompat for the ddraw.dll wrapper
- Ping IP/Host (useful for programs like ZeroTier, plus it always stays at the top, which will be much convienent when copying IPs/Hostnames)
- EQUINE will backup important game DLL/SNP files and restore them when uninstalling a mod
- Save game backup (along with mod/multiplayer support)
- Downloading/uninstalling mods
- Game version downgrader
- Force Update to 1.09
- IPX Wrapper support
- Mod folders!
- Mod updater
- GOG version support

Currenly in development:

Currently in planning:
- P2P Communication
- Mod config editor?
- Battle.Net Gateway Editor (Diablo 1 ONLY)
- Launcher for Tchernobog mod

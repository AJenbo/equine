EQUINE (or Easy & Quick Installation Environment) is a mod manager for the first Diablo game. EQUINE can download/uninstall mods created for the game, along with choosing a DDraw wrapper that best suit your system.


EQUINE uses XML for the mod database and it updates the file on every launch, keeping you fresh at any new mod that was submitted to EQUINE.


Currently EQUINE has the following features:

- Copy DIABDAT.MPQ from game CD
- Choose either StrangeBytes' or DDrawCompat for the ddraw.dll wrapper
- Ping IP/Host (useful for programs like ZeroTier, plus it always stays at the top, which will be much convienent when copying IPs/Hostnames)
- EQUINE will backup important game DLL/SNP files and restore them when uninstalling a mod
- Save game backup (along with mod/multiplayer support)
- Downloading/uninstlling mods


Currenly in development:

- Mod folders!

Currently in planning:
- P2P Communication
- IPX Wrapper support
- Mod config editor?
